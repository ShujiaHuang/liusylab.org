The Stroke Omics Atlas (STROMICS) is committed to using multi-omics and clinical big data to achieve accurate diagnosis and treatment for stroke patients, reduce treatment costs, and contribute to the health of the people.

Using artificial intelligence and cutting-edge high-throughput omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, etc.), potential drug targets for stroke can be found on a large scale and with high efficiency, providing strong technical support for clinical transformation.

Relying on the China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases and Center of excellence for Omics Research (CORe), STROMICS has realized the interdisciplinary integration of clinical medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics, creating a new paradigm of drug research and development.
