Dr. Liu is an Associate Professor and Ph.D. supervisor at the School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University. Her group focused on human genomics and bioinformatics research. Her expertise lies in the systematic analysis of key genes, genetic and evolutionary features, and causative environmental risk factors associated with human diseases and traits through bioinformatics, statistical, and machine learning algorithms. Her research aims to explore the molecular and systemic etiology of complex diseases and establish individual and population disease prediction and intervention models. Her major academic contributions include:

- Development of precise structural variation detection algorithms and elucidation of the frequency distribution and evolutionary patterns of structural variations in a pedigree population (co-first author in Nature, co-first author in Nature Communications, first author in GigaScience).
- Pioneering the use of large-scale ultra-low-depth sequencing data to investigate the genetics and molecular characteristics of complex diseases and quantitative traits, revealing the evolutionary history and plasma virus infection patterns in the Chinese population, and uncovering genes related to reproductive traits such as fertility age and twin pregnancy (first author in Cell).

Her work was published in high-profile journals such as CELL, NATURE, and Cell Discovery as a (co)-first or (co)-corresponding author and funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shenzhen Stable Support Fund, Guangdong Provincial Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund and National Key Research and Development Program.
