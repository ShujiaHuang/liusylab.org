abstract: "
Aims/hypothesis: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common disorder in pregnancy; however, its underlying causes remain obscure. This study aimed to investigate the genetic and molecular risk factors contributing to GDM and glycaemic traits.

Methods: We collected non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) sequencing data along with four glycaemic and 55 biochemical measurements from 30,699 pregnant women during a 2 year period at Shenzhen Baoan Women's and Children's Hospital in China. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted between genotypes derived from NIPTs and GDM diagnosis, baseline glycaemic levels and glycaemic levels after glucose challenges. In total, 3317 women were diagnosed with GDM, while 19,565 served as control participants. The results were replicated using two independent cohorts. Additionally, we performed one-sample Mendelian randomisation to explore potential causal associations between the 55 biochemical measurements and risk of GDM and glycaemic levels.

Results: We identified four genetic loci significantly associated with GDM susceptibility. Among these, MTNR1B exhibited the highest significance (rs10830963-G, OR [95% CI] 1.57 [1.45, 1.70], p=4.42Ã—10-29), although its effect on type 2 diabetes was modest. Furthermore, we found 31 genetic loci, including 14 novel loci, that were significantly associated with the four glycaemic traits. The replication rates of these associations with GDM, fasting plasma glucose levels and 0 h, 1 h and 2 h OGTT glucose levels were 4 out of 4, 6 out of 9, 10 out of 11, 5 out of 7 and 4 out of 4, respectively. Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested that a genetically regulated higher lymphocytes percentage and lower white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage and absolute neutrophil count were associated with elevated glucose levels and an increased risk of GDM.

Conclusions/interpretation: Our findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of GDM and glycaemic traits during pregnancy in an East Asian population and highlight the potential role of inflammatory pathways in the aetiology of GDM and variations in glycaemic levels.

Data availability: Summary statistics for GDM; fasting plasma glucose; 0 h, 1 h and 2h OGTT; and the 55 biomarkers are available in the GWAS Atlas (study accession no.: GVP000001, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gwas/browse/GVP000001) .
